Dynamic array implementation in C (WIP)
Inspired by a video from [tsoding](https://x.com/tsoding/status/1959694513355800660) on twitter

# Usage
Copy the da.h and da.c files into your project directory and compile your project with da.c
See `examples/example.c` for example usage of functions
Run `make example` to compile the example program

This is very much a work in progress project and currently only has support for int and string arrays. Functions include adding elements, removing elements by value and removing the last element in an array
